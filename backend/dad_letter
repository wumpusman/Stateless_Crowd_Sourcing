"petty: actually more to it.  thinking about it, my hesitation is not just about your unwillliness to visit yet you can travel over the country with no problems. And then have the nerve, maybe you think it is cute, that I visit you.

The abbreviated phone calls where you will virtually hang up etc.I can go on, but this not to do a guilt trip but I am almost 78 years old, I have been there for your entire lilfe, and I resent being treated in such an off hand way.

So from my vantage point, it is not being petty but reflects dissatisfaction in your disrespect bla bla.
Interesting, you are the only one of my friends or children, who won't go to the effort to read my poetry but yet you expect to listen to your ideas etc. Which I do.
but there is no reciprocation.

Michael, this is not about me but you.  You are 30 years old but in many you act to me (maybe also to your mother but she is more tolerant) like an adol.

I will always love you but I am not happy with your behavior..
