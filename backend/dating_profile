"I'm an introvert who enjoys reading and going for long, contemplative walks. I enjoy playing dungeons and dragons and videogaming, but I also enjoy cooking and going to the gym. I'm looking for a smart, curious woman who enjoys conversation and science."



"You should message me if:

If you're a smart, strong lady and you're looking for a partner and you want to get together for dinner and conversation."



"What I'm doing with my life:

I'm reading, wondering, working, being social, staying social, dreaming.

I read a lot about cognition, math, brains, and the social sciences, because I wonder a lot about how people work. For now I'm focusing on my job in linguistics and software, but I'd like to make some advances in AI. I'm fortunate to have many friends who live nearby, and I'm enjoying spending time with them.

I enjoy long walks, and I meditate to reduce anxiety, which constantly bubbles up to the surface if I stay still for too long.

I identify as a feminist, a Unitarian Universalist, a pragmatist, an effective altruist, and a left libertarian."
