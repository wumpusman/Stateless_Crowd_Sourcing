The young girl sat wearily under the beautiful Christmas tree and tried vainly to ignore the cold and wet.
 One foot was damp because one slipper had been stolen by her irritating brother, and having run from her house to escape from her violent Father, she had not had time to but her boots on.  Trying to take comfort from the memories of her loving Grandmother and the stories she told of stars she lit the last of her matches in a futile effort to stay warm.  Before the match goes out she sees the beauty of the tree and stars, a vision of her beloved Grandmother appears welcoming her soul to heaven as her body freezes and dies.
